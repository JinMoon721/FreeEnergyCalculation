# FreeEnergyCalculation
Running code for LAMMPS simulation to get free energy profile

Instruction
1. Add original restart file or geometry file "init0.restart" into ./Init/. Assume that we know the order parameters for this geoemtry
2. run /scripts/generateInit.sh ## it will generates initial restart files for all windows
3. check the histogram overlap


4. ready for running long simulation with initial geometries. run script
